<!--
// two ways of looking at it which is 
// top and bottom and then inbetween, top would then include the "body" tag
// or, the "functional" way I had been trying but I think slighty being off which would be
// head is it's own structure, body is it's own strucutre, and then it gets' passed to html, which is paired with a doctype.
// the question is how much overhead in that way of thinking is good.
