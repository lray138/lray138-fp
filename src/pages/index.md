# Continuum

I went to the Atlanta Tech Village's Mason St. location yesterday (Sept 18th, 2024) with the intent of doing a "brain dump" with everything I've been up to the past few years, and where I want to go.

It is now Friday, Sep 20 at 1:51 PM, and I've just settled in at the desk of my home office.

When I sat down at the Villge, I intended to spin up a WordPress instance, and use this theme Bear Blog theme (via Astro).  Although I still plan on doing that, as I started comparing the Astro build with how I've been doing it I realized maybe I'd had the wrong opionion about markdown.

It was the paragraph tag that broke the camels back.

So, I went to see about icoroprating markdown support and it went off rather seemlessly.  Now what about declaring these variables at the top.  It turns out that wasn't unique to Astro, and I learned what "frontmatter" was.  

Long story short, I came all this way to turn the Webpack setup into a static site generator. Or the option to use it that way.  It was originally build to create PHP components based on static HTML partials.  I've been a long time fan of ProcessWire CMS, and Wordpress.  I've been a PHP/MySQL/JavaScript developer for the entirety of my career.

I've been amused recently as I watch what's old is become new again.

OK, I just took a look at the Astro build and the I was goigng so say... 

Astro is probably for guys coming out of the React space realizing it's overkill unless your doing an App that's tryign to service a blah blah blah...

I'm not saddled with the burdon of that. 

I don't particularly like the synax, and since everything boils down to a string I'm still in favor of the EJS partials.

I also think with HTMX and FlightPHP for routing we can do some powerful stuff.

I still want to double back and work through the PureScript book I got. 

I also have a functional PHP track I need to finish, but most of the buisness applications have been discovered and implemented.
