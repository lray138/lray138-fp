# Hello World!

It's a wonderful life, but...

> It's a hard world to get a break in  
> All the good things have been taken  
> But, girl, there are ways to make certain things pay  
> Though I'm dressed in these rags  
> I'll wear sable some day

I went to the Atlanta Tech Village yesterday with the intent of doing a "brain dump" with everything I've been up to the past, Lord knows, how many years.

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to [read the docs](https://docs.astro.build/) or [join us on Discord](https://an.build/chat) to ask questions.
